            <p>The GMS (Gas Monitoring System) Project started in December 
                2018, when I decided that I wanted to actually shift all 
                of my focus to software engineering. It was a little too 
                late for me to change my major however that did not stop
                 me from learning, taking online courses and asking the 
                 questions that would get me to finish my project. </p>
<p>As my dad himself owns gas stations it only felt right to build a tool 
    that would help him manage his inventory as he has been losing up to 
    30% of the ordered fuel every year. The first path I took to deliver 
    the first version of the product was to build it completely out of 
    python and PyQt package. It was not the best approach however it made 
    me complete the database and have some sort of user interface to 
    present a product. Once this version was completed and deployed, I decided 
    to take another approach.  The second version was to simply create a 
    dashboard that clients could actually see their daily data that managers
     enter. The dashboard was coded using ruby on rails. From this project
      I learned the Model View Controller Software Architecture. </p>
<p>After trials and errors as to what works best, it brings us to 
    the latest version of GMS, which is the GMS Dashboard (beta). This 
    Web Application was created using javascript react library, python 
    backend, with a MySQL Database. After learning the different ways 
    that the application could be made, this is what I settled with 
    for now. This is the version that you see right now online. The GMS 
    project has helped me learn so much about making web applications, 
    managing databases, AWS, and the serverless framework.</p>
