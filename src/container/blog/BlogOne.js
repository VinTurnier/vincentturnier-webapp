<p>Welcome to my blog! I am excited for you to be here. My name is Vincent Turnier, 
I am a software engineer that loves music and beekeeping. As this is my first 
blog post, I will introduce to you a little bit about myself and history, as 
well as the topics that I will share my opinions on. Sit back, read, and enjoy 
the ride.</p>
<p>I got into software when I was about 14 or 15 years old. I’ve always been fascinated
about websites, applications and how computers operate. When I received my first 
computer, I started to learn HTML. Once I got into it, I decided that it was time 
for me to learn more programming languages. My next choice was python. Python was 
interesting, it took me a while to understand classes; however, once I did, I was 
able to expand my knowledge on programming architecture. After learning Python, 
I decided to add more scripting languages in my tool belt. Some of those tools 
include Java, C, ruby, and JavaScript. I enjoyed using Java, however I prefered 
python when writing backend programs, as it is dynamically typed.</p>
<p>Learning a programming language is not all there is in software (which is something 
I learned the hard way). There are a ton of API’s out there that are created to 
help you build applications or websites faster. These libraries are created by 
developers to help one accomplish programming tasks faster without having to reinvent 
the wheel. Some of my favorite libraries include Flask, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and 
Numpy for Python. React, rechart, and d3 for JavaScript. We are definitely going 
to cover all of these topics, all of them will include links to GitHub repositories.</p>
<p>As one starts becoming a programmer, the programming language that you choose 
is just a tool in your toolbelt. These tools give you the possibility to solve 
problems to help humans live a better life. In the following blog post I will talk 
about the built, test, deploy, and repeat mentality, which is very much related 
to the software development life cycle (SDLC). Other topics that we will cover 
include containers, CI/CD (Jenkins), Kubernetes, AWS (EC2, Lambda, Elastic BeanStalk, 
RDS, etc…), Projects that I have worked on, Podcasts that I listen to, and conferences 
that I will attend.  There is so much to talk about, I will make sure that everything 
is well organized to make it easy for one to find what is needed. As a software 
engineer, programmer, or whatever you want to call yourself, it is crucial to always 
learn, grow, and evolve as new technology continues to emerge, and always make sure 
that your code can actually solve problems.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading my first blog post, I hope to see you around and 
enjoy browsing!</p>
